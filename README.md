# Pong Game

This project is a simple implementation of the Pong game using HTML canvas and JavaScript. Pong is a classic arcade game where two players control paddles and try to hit the ball past each other. The objective is to score points by successfully hitting the ball and preventing it from crossing the player's side.

## Features

- Scoring system: Each time the ball passes the opponent's paddle, a point is awarded to the scoring player. The scores are displayed on the screen.
- Sound effects: The game includes sound effects for ball hits, wall collisions, and score updates.
- Responsive design: The game adapts to different screen sizes and maintains its aspect ratio.
- Restart functionality: Players can restart the game by clicking the restart button after a player reaches a score of 10.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: The game structure and user interface are built using HTML5 markup.
- CSS: Styling and visual effects are applied using CSS3.
